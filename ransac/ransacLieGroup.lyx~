\begin_layout Title
Multiple Target Tracking on Lie Groups Using Recursive-RANSAC
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Target tracking is challenging field of research since it deals with tracking
 a target whose internal forces are unknown.
 Some other challenges to target tracking are computational complexities,
 fitting a system model to the target, identifying the number of targets
 in a surveillance region, initializing tracks (target models) of targets,
 and determining if a track represents an actual target.
 The latter challenges are often removed, depending on the type of tracking
 algorithm, by assuming that the target type is known and thus the system
 model is known, the number of targets are known, and tracks are initialized.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There exists optimal algorithms for multiple target tracking (MTT) such
 as the multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) .The MHT algorithm is a batch
 tracker that uses a hard data association technique.
 It is an optimal algorithm since it considers all possible measurement
 associations in order to create the hypotheses tree.
 While MHT is an optimal algorithm, it is not feasible unless appropriate
 techniques are used to limit the number of generated hypotheses: pruning,
 merging, sliding window, etc.
 When these techniques are used, the algorithm is suboptimal.
 Lastly, the algorithm is capable of initializing and pruning tracks.
 There are two variants of MHT: measurement-oriented (MO-MHT) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Reid1979"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and track-oriented (TO-MHT) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kurien1990"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The TO-MHT is capable of real time tracking for moderately simple tracking
 scenarios.
 Because of these limitations, we rely on suboptimal tracking algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of these common suboptimal algorithms are the global nearest neighbor
 (GNN), the joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF), the probabilist
ic multi-hypothesis tracker (PHMT) and the probability hypothesis density
 (PHD).
 Each of these algorithms have variants that trade optimality for computational
 feasibility.
 There are also many other MTT algorithms which we will not discussed here
 but we refer the reader to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pulford2005"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 for a survey of the more common algorithms.
 We briefly present some of these common algorithms in order to compare
 and contrast them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GNN is the simplest MTT method.
 It is a single-scan tracker that uses hard data association to assign measureme
nts to tracks based on distance without taking into account statistical
 information such as the innovation term 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bar-Shalom2011"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The GNN filter is a computationally efficient algorithm, but its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

greedy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 data association causes track divergence and loss in clutter.
 This method requires an additional scheme to prune, initialize and merge
 tracks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The JPDAF is an extension of the probabilistic data association filter (PDAF)
 to multiple target tracking.
 It is a single-scan tracker that uses a soft data association technique
 to weighs new measurements inside a track's validation region based upon
 the new measurement's joint data association probability 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bar-Shalom2009"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The weights are used to update the tracks.
 Even though it is a single-scan tracker, calculating the joint probability
 of all possible data associations per scan makes it more computationally
 complex and demanding.
 In addition, this method requires an additional scheme to prune, initialize
 and merge tracks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The PHMT is a soft data association algorithm that relaxes the criteria
 that a track can only produce at most one measurement per time step.
 It does this by using a combination of the maximum likelihood and expectation
 maximization algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dempster1977"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 to maximize the posterior probability of the tracks given a batch of measuremen
ts or a windowed batch of measurements.
 In the original form, it didn't have a method of track initialization or
 pruning, but later variants used the Hugh transform or the MHT as a front
 end to initialize tracks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Crousey2009"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The PHMT performance is similar to that of the PDAF which is a single-scan
 tracker 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bar-Shalom2011"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 A variant of the PHMT operates on a windowed batch of data, and can be
 used as a single-scan tracker.
 Regardless of the variant of the PHMT, this method requires an additional
 scheme to prune and merge tracks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The PHD ...
 Talk about it with references.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A recently new MTT algorithm is Recursive Random Sample Consensus (R-RANSAC).
 It has a modular paradigm that can be easily implemented in real time,
 and is capable of track initialization, pruning, and merging.
 Another novelty of the algorithm is that the surveillance region doesn't
 need to be fixed, but can change provided that a transformation is available
 to transform measurements and tracks from the previous surveillance to
 the current one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
R-RANSAC was first designed to estimate the parameters of multiple static
 signals 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Niedfeldt2013"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, but it was quickly extended to track multiple dynamic targets 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Niedfeldt"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Since then, R-RANSAC has been improved, modified and changed in various
 literature 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Niedfeldt2014b,Niedfeldt2014,Niedfeldt2016,Ingersoll2015,Ingersoll2015a,Defranco2015,Lusk2018,Niedfeldt2017,Wikle2017,Millard2017,Yang2017,Yang2018"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 All of these improvements seemed to have stemmed from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Niedfeldt"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, which resulted in many different variants of R-RANSAC.
 This paper aims at aggregating the best contributions while adding some
 of our own improvements.
 Our specific contributions include removing the constraint that measurements
 come at a fixed time interval, improving the criteria for determining if
 a track represents an actual target, allowing the measurement and process
 noise covariance to change at every time step, extending the theory of
 R-RANSAC to any Lie group, modifying the model merging method and give
 several example implementation.

The objective of this section is to provide a brief review and establish
 notation of the pertinent concepts of Lie theory.
 In this document we will focus on targets with a discrete system model
 and constant velocity, this is merely to simplify the presentation of the
 material.
 With no loss in generality, everything we present can be extended to targets
 with a continuous system model and constant acceleration by using a semidirect
 product group formed from a Lie group and its Lie algebra.
 A good discussion of the semidirect product group can be found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 If using a continuous system that requires numerical integration on the
 manifold, we refer the reader to

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 denote a Lie group and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{g}$
\end_inset

 denote it's corresponding Lie algebra.
 The exponential function is a surjection that maps an element of the Lie
 algebra to an element of the Lie group, and the logarithmic map is the
 inverse of the exponential map.
 We denote these maps as
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\exp:\mathfrak{g} & \to G\\

\end{align*}

\end_inset


\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 The definition of these maps is dependent on the Lie group.
 For matrix Lie groups, the exponential and logarithm maps are defined as
 the matrix exponential and matrix logarithm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lie algebra is isomorphic to the Euclidean space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the dimension of the Lie algebra.
 We will denote this Euclidean space as 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

.
 The Wedge function maps an element from the Euclidean space to the Lie
 algebra, and the Vee function is the inverse function which we denote as
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

begin{subequations}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\cdot^{\wedge}:E\to\mathfrak{g} & \quad\left(v\right)\mapsto v^{\wedge}\\

The definitions of these maps are dependent on the Lie algebra.
 We will rely on context to distinguish between elements of

\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{g}$

 denotes the group operator which we will omit in the future, and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{2}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is the inverse element of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 We have based the definition of these function on left trivializations
 (using vector fields that are left invariant) since we will present the
 material using the left trivialization.
 Note that we could easily use the right trivialization as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The adjoint of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is a representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 that acts on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{g}$
\end_inset

 and is denoted and generically defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
Ad_{g}:\mathfrak{g} & \to\mathfrak{g};\quad\left(u\right)\mapsto gug^{-1}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $g\in G$
\end_inset

.
 Since the adjoint is a linear function, we can find a matrix version that
 operates on the associated Euclidean space generically defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{Ad}_{g}:E\to E;\quad\left(v\right)\mapsto\mathbf{Ad}_{g}v
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Ad}_{g}$
\end_inset

 is the matrix adjoint representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

.
 A useful property of the adjoint is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g\text{Exp}\left(v\right)=\text{Exp}\left(\mathbf{Ad}_{g}v\right)g.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The adjoint of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{g}$
\end_inset

 is a representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{g}$
\end_inset

 that acts on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{g}$
\end_inset

 It is also the Lie bracket 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\cdot,\cdot\right]$
\end_inset

 which we will generically define as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
ad_{u}:\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{g};\quad\left(v\right)\mapsto\left[u,v\right]
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in\mathfrak{g}$

 Since the adjoint is a linear function, we can find a matrix version that
 operates on the associated Euclidean space generically defined as 
\begin_inset Formula

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As stated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Iserles2000a"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, we can define the differential of the exponential mapping as the 'left
 trivialized' tangent of the exponential map or as the 'right trivialized'
 tangent of the exponential map.
 These differentials are also commonly called the right and left Jacobians.
 The right and left Jacobians 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{r},J_{l}:E\to GL\left(E\right)$
\end_inset

 are defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
J_{r}\left(v\right) & =\frac{^{r}\partial\text{Exp}\left(v\right)}{\partial v} &  & J_{l}\left(v\right)=\frac{^{l}\partial\text{Exp}\left(v\right)}{\partial v}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their inverses are defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
J_{r}^{-1}\left(v\right) & =\frac{^{r}\partial\text{Log}\left(v\right)}{\partial v} &  & J_{l}^{-1}\left(v\right)=\frac{^{l}\partial\text{Log}\left(v\right)}{\partial v}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The right Jacobian has the property that for small 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta v\in E$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v\in E$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{Exp}\left(\delta v+u\right) & \approx\text{Exp}\left(v\right)\text{Exp}\left(J_{r}\left(v\right)\delta v\right)\\
\text{Exp}\left(v\right)\text{Exp}\left(\delta v\right) & \approx\text{Exp}\left(v+J_{r}^{-1}\left(v\right)\delta v\right)\\
\text{Log}\left(\text{Exp}\left(v\right)\text{Exp}\left(\delta v\right)\right) & \approx v+J_{r}^{-1}\left(v\right)\delta v.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The left Jacobian has the similar property that for small 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta v\in E$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v\in E$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{Exp}\left(v+\delta v\right) & \approx\text{Exp}\left(J_{l}\left(v\right)\delta v\right)\text{Exp}\left(v\right)\\
\text{Exp}\left(\delta v\right)\text{Exp}\left(v\right) & \approx\text{Exp}\left(v+J_{l}^{-1}\left(v\right)\delta v\right)\\
\text{Log}\left(\text{Exp}\left(\delta v\right)\text{Exp}\left(v\right)\right) & \approx v+J_{l}^{-1}\left(v\right)\delta v.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 Another useful property of the left and right Jacobians are 
\begin_inset Formula

J_{l}\left(-v\right) & =J_{r}\left(v\right)

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\xi_{u}\left(g\right)=\left.\frac{d}{dt}\right|_{t=0}g\boxplus\left(tv\right)

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a very simplified definition that serves our purpose in deriving
 the discrete system model.
 For a more formal and encompassing definition of an infinitesimal generator,
 we refer the reader to the authors already mentioned.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The targets will be modeled using a constant velocity system.
 The state is a new group formed from the semidirect product of the Lie
 group and the corresponding Euclidean space denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\left(g,v\right)\in G\ltimes E$
\end_inset

.
 It's group operator and inverse are defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
x_{1}\bullet x_{2} & =\left(g_{1}g_{2},\mathbf{Ad}_{g_{2}^{-1}}v_{1}+v_{2}\right),\\
x_{1}^{-1} & =\left(g_{1}^{-1},-\mathbf{Ad}_{g_{1}}v_{1}\right).
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The purpose of the adjoints in the group operator is to transform the velocity
 to the proper tangent space so that they can be added together.

The Lie algebra and the corresponding Euclidean space of 
\begin_inset Formula $G\ltimes E$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{g}\ltimes E$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E\ltimes E$
\end_inset

.
 The exponential and logarithmic maps are defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{Exp}\left(\left(a,b\right)\right) & =\left(\text{Exp}\left(a\right),J_{r}\left(a\right)b\right)\\

\begin_inset Formula $\left(a,b\right)\in E\ltimes E$
\end_inset

 and

 Lastly, the ominus operator is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}\in E$

 We assume the state transition model to be continuous, near constant velocity,
 and time invariant which we define as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\dot{g}_{k} & =\xi_{u_{k}}\left(g_{k}\right)\\

\end_inset

 is process noise sampled from a zero-mean, white-noise, Gaussian distribution

\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 Under the assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{k}$
\end_inset

 stays constant over a time period 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{k}$

Targets are observed via sensors.
 Each sensor perceives a subset of the measurement space called a local
 surveillance region (LSR) which has a local frame that the data is expressed
 in and a volume denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{vol}$
\end_inset

.
 The union of all LSRs is called the global surveillance region (GSR).
 Measurements are extracted from the data using algorithms.
 We call the unique sensor and algorithm pair a measurement source or source
 for short.
 In the case that multiple sources have the same sensor, it is possible
 for duplication of information which, when incorporated into a state estimate
 of a target, would lead to overconfidence of the state estimate.
 We do not have a way to account for this except to assume it is minimal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A sensor scan occurs when a source produces new measurements.
 Measurements from a source can be either false or true measurements.
 We assume that false measurements are uniformly distributed in the LSR,
 and that the number of false measurements from a source per sensor scan
 can be modeled using a Poisson distribution with parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 being the expected value.
 The expected number of false measurements per unit volume is called the
 spacial density and is 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\frac{\Lambda}{S_{vol}}$
\end_inset

.
 We also assume that a measurement source provides at most one true measurement
 per target every sensor scan with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{D}$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 the probability of detection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
R-RANSAC works in a single frame requiring all of the measurements to be
 transformed and expressed in a single global frame before being given to
 R-RANSAC.
 In the case that the global frame changes, a transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 must be provided to R-RANSAC that contains the information necessary to
 transform all the past measurements and models stored in R-RANSAC into
 the new global frame.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
R-RANSAC uses the new measurements along with all the previous measurements
 from the time window 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{W}$
\end_inset

 to track targets.
 As time progresses, old measurements fall outside the time window and are
 removed.
 These measurements are called expired measurements.
 Below is a summary of our assumptions.

\begin_layout Enumerate

Modular Paradigm
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Modular-Paradigm"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The paradigm for R-RANSAC is designed to be very modular.
 In this section we will present the data structures used and modular framework.
 R-RANSAC can be broken down into three main parts: data management, track
 initialization, and track management.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data Structures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In R-RANSAC, we use three different data structures: the data tree, clusters,
 and consensus sets.
 The structure of the data tree and clusters is a list of R*-Trees 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Daszykowski2009"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Each R*-Tree contains measurements obtained at a unique time.
 This allows us to easily remove and add measurements that have the same
 time stamp while being able to search the data structures quickly.
 The data tree contains all of the measurements within the time window that
 are not in a cluster or a consensus set.
 A cluster, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

, contains neighboring measurements as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yang2017"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{C}:N\times N\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 be a metric 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Moon2000"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 on the measurement space.
 A measurement 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{j}$
\end_inset

 is a neighboring measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{C}\left(y_{j},y_{k}\right)<\tau_{CD}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{CD}$
\end_inset

 being a user defined parameter.
 A consensus set, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{CS}^{i}$
\end_inset

, is a list that contains all of the measurements within the time window
 that were associated with the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 track.
 A track, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}$
\end_inset

, is a model of a target consisting of the state estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}$
\end_inset

; error covariance 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

; consensus set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{CS}$
\end_inset

; track likelihood, 
\begin_inset Formula $TL$
\end_inset

; and label, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 , i.e.
 the tuple 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{T}=\left(\hat{x},P,\mathcal{CS},TL,L\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The track likelihood is a measurement of how 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a track is.
 Previously, this was based on the inlier ratio and track lifetime, see
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Niedfeldt2017"
literal "true"

\end_inset

; however, we will present a more probabilistic approach in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Track-Likelihood"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data Management
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data management occurs after a sensor scan provides new measurements 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{k}$
\end_inset

 and a new transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 First, expired measurements are removed from the data structures and models
 are propagated forward in time.
 If a transformation was provided, all of the measurements (not including
 the new measurements since they should already be expressed in the current
 global frame) and tracks are transformed to the current global frame, i.e.
 their state estimate and error covariance are transformed to the current
 global frame.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The new measurements are checked to see if they should be associated to
 a track and used to update the track's state estimate and likelihood.
 The data association and track update could be implemented using any single
 scan tracker.
 Our data association method is described in subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Data-Association"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Unassociated new measurements are then checked to see if they belong to
 an existing cluster using the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{C}$
\end_inset

.
 Those that don't belong to a cluster are then used to seed possible new
 clusters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
New clusters are created by taking an unassociated new measurement and finding
 neighboring measurements from either the list of unassociated new measurements
 or the data tree.
 For every measurement added to the cluster, the process is repeated by
 finding neighboring measurements to the measurement just added to the cluster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the possible cluster has at least 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{CM}$
\end_inset

 measurements, then the cluster is kept, and the associated measurements
 are removed from the data tree.
 The remaining unassociated measurements are placed on the data tree creating
 a new element in the list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Track Initialization and Track Management
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Track initialization and track management occurs at times specified by the
 user.
 The track initialization phase performs RANSAC, see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:RANSAC"

\end_inset

, on each cluster to try to generate new tracks.
 If RANSAC generates a new track, the new track's state estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}$
\end_inset

 is filtered and the track's likelihood is initialized using the measurements
 in the consensus set.
 The measurements in the consensus set are removed from the respective cluster.
 Since measurements are taken from a cluster in order to create a new track,
 we must verify that the remaining measurements in the cluster still form
 a valid cluster, i.e.
 the cluster has at least 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{CM}$
\end_inset

 measurements.
 If it does, the cluster is kept.
 If it doesn't, then we check the time stamp of the measurements.
 If the measurements are old (i.e.
 near being expired), then we remove them; otherwise, we place them back
 on the data tree.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last phase of R-RANSAC is track management which consists of merging
 and pruning tracks, promoting and demoting tracks, and assigning new good
 tracks a unique label.
 Some tracks will begin to coalesce as they are propagated and updated.
 If these tracks are deemed similar, they are merged together using the
 track-to-track fusion method discussed in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Track-to-Track-fusion"

\end_inset

.
 Since R-RANSAC stores up to 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 Tracks, if there are more than 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 tracks we remove the tracks with the lowest likelihood.
 If a track's likelihood is above the threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\rho}$
\end_inset

 then it is promoted to a good track; otherwise, it is a poor track.
 Good tracks receive a unique numerical label to identify it , 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Ingersoll2015a"

\end_inset

.
 At the end of these phases, a list of good tracks is published to the user.

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned in the introduction, there are a variety of ways to propagate
 the models, associate measurements, and update the models with the associated
 measurements.
 For our implementation, we have chosen to use the Probabilistic Data Associatio
n Filter (PDAF) even though we are tracking multiple targets
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bar-Shalom2009"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Because of the modular design of R-RANSAC we could implement it with a
 JPDAF, but we decided that the little increase in tracking accuracy is
 not worth the large increase in computation as discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ingersoll2015a"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In this section we present the PDAF in a Lie group setting focusing only
 on the parts we believe need further discussion.
 For some additional background on presenting Lie groups in a probabilistic
 frame work we refer the reader to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bourmaud2013a,Bourmaud2014"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 We also follow some of the derivation, convention, notation and terminology
 from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Reid2001,Reid2001a,Thrun2006"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 but adapted for the Lie group setting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We present the PDAF for one target, but it is trivially extended to the
 case of multiple targets.
 Also, the PDAF is orignally designed to work with a single measurement
 source, but we extend it to work with multiple measurement sources.
 To facilitate this, we establish additional notation.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}=\left\{ 1,\ldots,N_{s}\right\} $
\end_inset

 be the indexing set of sources with 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{s}$
\end_inset

 being the number of sources, and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{m}^{s}$
\end_inset

 being the set of measurements associated to the model at time 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 produced by source 
\begin_inset Formula $s\in\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

.
 It is possible that 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{m}^{s}=\emptyset$
\end_inset

 if a source didn't produce any measurements.
 We assume that each source produces at most one measurement originated
 from a target with probability of detection 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{D}^{s}$
\end_inset

.
 Also, the source produces clutter (noisy measurements) uniformly in the
 local surveillance region, where the number of clutter measurements per
 scan is modeled with a Poisson distribution with spatial density 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{s}$
\end_inset

.
 The spatial density 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{s}$
\end_inset

 is the expected number of clutter measurements per sensor scan divided
 by the volume of the local surveillance region.
 Lastly, let 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{m}^{s,j}\in Y_{m}^{s}$
\end_inset

 denote the 
\begin_inset Formula $j^{th}$
\end_inset

 measurement in 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{m}^{s}$
\end_inset

 assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{m}^{s}\neq\emptyset$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Propagation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we present the model propagation step used in the PDAF adapted
 to Lie groups.
 When working with Lie groups, uncertainty is modeled in the Cartesian space
 isomorphic to the Lie algebra since Gaussian distributions are defined
 in Cartesian space.
 To demonstrate this, we denote the state estimate at time 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}_{m}\in G\times E$
\end_inset

 and the true state as 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{m}\in G\times E$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x_{m}\in E^{*}$
\end_inset

 denote a local perturbation around 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}_{m}$
\end_inset

 that is a zero-mean, Gaussian, random variable with error covariance 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{m}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{m}=\hat{x}_{m}\oplus\delta x_{m}.
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\delta x_{m}$
\end_inset

 is the error of the estimate or mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}_{m}$
\end_inset

.
 When representing the probability of a state 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{m}$
\end_inset

, we represent it using the error that's in the Cartesian space.
 For example, the probability of the prior distribution, or the belief distribut
ion, 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(x_{m}\right)$
\end_inset

, is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
p\left(x_{m}\right) & =\eta\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(x_{m}\ominus\hat{x}_{m}\right)^{\top}P_{m}^{-1}\left(x_{m}\ominus\hat{x}_{m}\right)\right)\\
 & =\eta\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\delta x_{m}^{\top}P_{m}^{-1}\delta x\right),
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is a normalizing coefficient corresponding to the Gaussian distribution.
 We will use 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 to denote any normalizing coefficient.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The state of the model is propagated according to the system model which
 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{m}=f\left(x_{m^{-}},w_{m},\delta_{m}\right).
\]

\end_inset

The process noise 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{m}$
\end_inset

, and the previous state 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{m^{-}}$
\end_inset

 are both random variables, and we are interested in 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(x_{m}\right)$
\end_inset

 assuming we know 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(x_{m^{-}}\right)$
\end_inset

 the measurement originated from the target.
 These weights are calculated for each measurement source.
 Let

 The weight is calculate as
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{s}V_{m,vol}^{s}$
\end_inset

.
 We assume that a measurement source can only produce at most one true measureme
nt during a sensor scan.
 Therefore, we have the two possibilities for 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\theta_{k}^{s}\mid z\right)$
\end_inset

: that all 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{k}^{s}$
\end_inset

 measurements are false or all but one are false.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{multline*}
p\left(\theta_{k}^{s}\mid z\right)=P_{G}P_{D}^{s}\exp\left(\lambda^{s}V_{vol}^{s}\right)\frac{\left(\lambda^{s}V_{vol}^{s}\right)^{\left(\theta_{k}^{s}-1\right)}}{\left(\theta_{k}^{s}-1\right)!}\\
+\left(1-P_{G}^{s}P_{D}^{s}\right)\exp\left(\lambda^{s}V_{vol}^{s}\right)\frac{\left(\lambda^{s}V_{vol}^{s}\right)^{\theta_{k}^{s}}}{\left(\theta_{k}^{s}\right)!}.
\end{multline*}

\end_inset

There is only one possibility for 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(\theta_{k}^{s}\mid\neg z\right)$
\end_inset

, that is the probability of all of the measurements being false 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(\theta_{k}^{s}\mid\neg z\right)=\exp\left(\lambda^{s}V_{vol}^{s}\right)\frac{\left(\lambda^{s}V_{vol}^{s}\right)^{\theta_{k}^{s}}}{\left(\theta_{k}^{s}\right)!}.
\]

\end_inset

Taking the ratio of the two gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{p\left(\theta_{k}^{s}\mid z\right)}{p\left(\theta_{k}^{s}\mid\neg z\right)}=1+P_{G}^{s}P_{D}^{s}\left(\frac{\theta_{k}^{s}}{\lambda^{s}V_{vol}^{s}}-1\right).
\]

\begin_layout Standard
If a track is outside the local surveillance region (LSR) of the 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{th}$

 source, then 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{D}^{s}$
\end_inset

 should be zero and 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(z\mid\theta_{m:k}\right)$
\end_inset

 will not be affected.
 In the case that the track leaves the global surveillance region (GSR),
 we need a way to kill the track in order to make room for other tracks
 to be initialized.
 Thus, we assume that a track that has not received a measurement within
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 seconds is no longer in the GSR and will be pruned.
 A track is considered a good track if the 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(z\mid\theta_{m:k}\right)>\tau_{\rho}$
\end_inset

; otherwise, it is considered a poor track.
 A good track receives a unique indentifiable label.

\begin_layout Standard
As tracks are propagated and updated they can begin to coalesce in which
 case we need to merge/fuse them.
 In order to optimally fuse them, we would need to calculate the cross covarianc
e between two tracks which is computationally complex and time expensive,
 or in our case unknown.
 Fortunately, the covariance intersection (CI) method can be used to fuse
 two tracks together without calculating the cross covariance 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 We use the variation of the CI method presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 called the sampled covariance intersection (SCI) method.
 In order to see if two tracks need to be fused together, we use a track
 association method prescribed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In this section we will briefly present the track association and fusion
 methods adapted to the Lie group setting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Track Association

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}^{i}$
\end_inset

 denote the state estimate of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 track and 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{i}$
\end_inset

 be the corresponding error covariance.
 The estimation error between two tracks is denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta^{ij}$
\end_inset

 and defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta^{ij}=\hat{x}^{i}\ominus\hat{x}^{j}.
\]

\end_inset

Assuming that the two tracks are independent, the covariance of the estimation
 error is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T^{ij}=P^{i}+P^{j}.
\]

\end_inset

We next define a metric 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{T}:\left(G\times\mathfrak{g}\right)\times\left(G\times\mathfrak{g}\right)\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 to be
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d_{T}\left(\hat{x}^{i},\hat{x}^{j}\right)=\left(\Delta^{ij}\right)^{\top}\left(T^{ij}\right)^{-1}\Delta^{ij}.
\]

\end_inset

If 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{T}\left(\cdot,\cdot\right)<\tau_{S}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{S}\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

, then the two tracks are deemed to be the same and should be merged.

\end_inset

 denote the state estimates of the tracks that need to be fused together
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{i}$
\end_inset

 be their corresponding error covariance.
 The fused estimate in SCI is calculated as if the tracks to be fused are
 independent; therefore,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
P^{-1} & =\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(P^{i}\right)^{-1}\\
\hat{x}_{SCI} & =P\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(P^{i}\right)^{-1}\hat{x}^{i}\right).
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For Lie group settings, the state update is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{x}_{SCI}=\hat{x}^{1}\oplus\left(P\sum_{i=2}^{n}\left(\left(P^{i}\right)^{-1}\left(\hat{x}^{i}\ominus\hat{x}^{1}\right)\right)\right),
\]

\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{\text{min}}=\min_{j=1,\ldots,N}\frac{\left(x^{j}\right)^{\top}P^{-1}x^{j}}{\underset{i=1,\ldots,N}{\max}\left\{ \left(x^{j}\right)^{\top}\left(P^{i}\right)^{-1}x^{j}\right\} }

\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $u\in\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

 is used to adjust the performance of the SCI algorithm.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $u=1$
\end_inset

, the fused covariance is conservative and when 
\begin_inset Formula $u=0$
\end_inset

, the fused covariance is optimistic.
 The authors of

The fused track will have the state estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}_{SCI}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, when tracks are fused, we merge their consensus sets together,
 give the merged track the highest model likelihood out of the tracks merged,
 and the label pertaining to the track that was first created out of the
 merged track.
 We note that it would be more correct to keep a history of the information
 needed to calculate the model's likelihood so that when tracks are merged
 we could recompute the model likelihood; however, such a task can require
 a lot of memory and computation depending on the amount of time merged
 models have existed.

 RANSAC is used to initialize new targets.
 A target that is not initialized (not being tracked by R-RANSAC) is producing
 measurements captured by the measurement sources.
 Provided that the measurements of the un-initialized target are not in
 the validation region of any initialized target, its measurements are not
 associated with any existing initialized target; thus, they are given to
 the data tree.
 The measurements produced by the un-initialized target are neighboring
 and will eventually form a cluster

Once a track hypothesis is generated, we score it according to its inliers.
 Inliers are measurements that support the hypothetical track.
 To determine if a measurement is an inlier, we use a very similar idea

 The only difference is that we create the validation regions not only at

\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $y_{m}$

\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is the estimated measurement defined in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The measurement 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{m}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{I}$

 This similarity allows us to calcuated 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{I}$
\end_inset

 based on a probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{I}$

 which we call the probability of being an inlier.
 The score of a track hypothesis is the number of times a measurement source
 produced an inlier at a certain time step.
 This means that if a source produced multiple inliers at time 
\begin_inset Formula $m$

\begin_inset Formula $1$

 If the score of a hypothetical track reaches the threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{RE}$

 a track with that hypothetical track.
 Othewise, RANSAC uses the best hypotetical track (provided that the hypothetica

\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{RM}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To initialize a track, we propagate 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{k}^{h}$

, and initialize the error covariance 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}$
\end_inset

 Using the PDAF, we propgate and update 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}^{h}$

 using it's inliers to procude a current estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{k}$

 and error covariance

 This process is called filtering.
 The inliers are also used to calculate the model likelihood.
 Once the track is initialized, the inliers are added to the track's consensus

 can be computationally expensive if the system is nonlinear.
 The purpose of the optimization problem is to generate a hypothetical track
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{k}^{h}$

 which is later refined using its inlieries via filtering.
 So the hypothetical track produced by the LMLE doesn't have to be super
 refined; therefore, we can simplify the optimization process in different
 ways.

Let's assume that the pose of the system is measurable.
 In other words, your observation model 
\begin_inset Formula $h$

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h\left(x_{k},v_{k}\right)=g_{k}\exp\left(v_{k}\right),

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{k}=g_{k}\exp\left(v_{k}\right).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When generating a track hypothesis, we always use a measurement from the
 current time.
 We can use this measurement as the estimated pose 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 All that remains is estimating the velocity term 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}$
\end_inset

 using one other measurement 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{m}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $m<k$
\end_inset

.
 Under the assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{k}$
\end_inset

 is the true current state, the measurement 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{m}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{m}=g_{k}\exp\left(\delta_{k:m}u_{k}+\delta_{k:m}w_{k}^{g}+\frac{\delta_{k:m}^{2}}{2}w_{k}^{u}\right)\exp\left(v_{m}\right),
\]

\end_inset

which can be approximated as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{m}\approx g_{k}\exp\left(\delta_{k:m}u_{k}+\delta_{k:m}w_{k}^{g}+\frac{\delta_{k:m}^{2}}{2}w_{k}^{u}+v_{m}\right)
\]

\end_inset

By calculating the error between the measurement and the current state we
 get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
y_{m}\ominus g_{k} & =\log\left(g_{k}^{-1}y_{m}\right)\\
e_{k:m} & \approx\delta_{k:m}u_{k}+\delta_{k:m}w_{k}^{g}+\frac{\delta_{k:m}^{2}}{2}w_{k}^{u}+v_{m}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The expected value of 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{k:m}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{E}\left[e_{k:m}\right]=\delta_{k:m}u_{k},
\]

\end_inset

and the covariance is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{cov}\left[e_{k:m}\right] & \approx\delta_{k:m}^{2}Q^{g}+\frac{\delta_{k:m}^{4}}{4}Q^{u}+R\\
 & =S_{k:m}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q=\begin{bmatrix}Q^{g} & 0\\
0 & Q^{u}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset

We can simply estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}$
\end_inset

 by letting 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}=e_{k:m}/\delta_{k:m}$
\end_inset

.
 We can enhance the estimate using multiple measurements.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 be an index set such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\cup_{m\in\chi}\left\{ y_{m}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is the set of measurements we will use to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{k}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{k}=\left(\sum_{j\in\Lambda}\delta_{k:j}S_{k:j}^{-1}\right)^{-1}\left(\sum_{j\in\Lambda}S_{k:j}^{-1}e_{k:j}\right).
\]

\end_inset

We can simplify the estimation further by setting the covariance terms to
 identity which yields 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{k}=\frac{1}{\left|\chi\right|}\sum_{j\in\Lambda}e_{k:j}.
\]

\begin_inset Formula $S_{k:m}^{s}$
\end_inset

 can be computationally costly when it has to be done thousands of times
 whenever RANSAC is performed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want the estimation to be as accurate as possible, we suggest you
 use the simplified approaches to seed the original optimization problem
 unless the system is linear since the original optimization problem is
 already simple.

In this section we provide three examples of increasing complexity.
 The first example is to show how Lie group framework of R-RANSAC applies
 to Euclidean spaces of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $n\in\mathbb{N}$

 The second example applies R-RANSAC to tracking targets on an image plane,

\begin_layout Standard
This is a brief section to show how the Lie group theory applies to Euclidean
 spaces of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n\in\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset

, equipped with the standard topology and the group operation of addition.
 Its corresponding Lie algebra is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

, and the adjoint, exponential, and left and right Jacobians are the identity
 map.
 The box plus/minus and o plus/minus mapping are trivially derived; for
 example
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
g\oplus u & =g+u\\
g_{1}\ominus g_{2} & =g_{1}-g_{2}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $g,g_{1},g_{2}\in G=\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in\mathfrak{g}=\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can write the system model as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
g_{k} & =g_{k^{-}}+\delta_{k}\left(u_{k^{-}}+w_{k}^{g}\right)+\frac{\delta_{k}^{2}}{2}w_{k}^{u}\\
u_{k} & =u_{k^{-}}+\delta_{k}w_{k}^{u}\\
y_{k} & =g_{k}+v_{k},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

which can be written in familiar matrix notation as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
x_{k} & =A_{k}x_{k^{-}}+B_{k}w_{k}\\
y_{k} & =Cx_{k}+v_{k}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{k}=\left[g_{k}^{\top},u_{k}^{\top}\right]^{\top}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
A_{k}=\begin{bmatrix}I & \delta_{k}I\\
0 & I
\end{bmatrix}, & \thinspace & B_{k}=\begin{bmatrix}\delta_{k}I & \frac{\delta_{k}^{2}}{2}I\\
0 & \delta_{k}I
\end{bmatrix},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C=\begin{bmatrix}I_{2\times2} & 0_{2\times2}\end{bmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset

In this form, we can easily recognize it as an linear time-invariant system
 with near constant velocity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Jacobians are easily computed and are 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{k}=A_{k}$

\begin_inset Formula $H_{k}=C$

\begin_inset Formula $F_{k:m}=CA_{k:m}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $G_{k:m}=CB_{k:m}$
\end_inset

 For linear systems, the LMLE simplifies to a least squares problem.

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose we have a camera fixed on a UAV tracking a moving target that is
 restricted to a planar surface.
 Tracking is done in the normalized virtual camera frame because it is invariant
 to pitch and yaw of the UAV and invariant to the camera's intrinsic parameters.
 If the tracking were done in the normalized camera frame, then when the
 UAV pitches or rolls, the motion of the target my no longer fit a constant
 velocity model because the trajectory could be an ellipse in the new frame
 instead of a circle.
 For this purpose, we perform tracking on the normalized virtual image plane
 (NVIP); hence, the global frame is the NVIP, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}^{n}$
\end_inset

, and the local frame is the camera frame 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}^{c}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The volume of the surveillance region is the area of the normalized virtual
 image plane.
 Since the UAV is moving, the global frame is also moving.
 This means that we must provide a transformation so that we can transform
 all measurements and models to the current global frame.
 We do this using the Homography as described in appendix ...

\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}\in\mathbb{R}^{2}$

 Using point measurements, we proceed to find under what conditions is the
 system observable.
 To do this, we linearize the observation error at different time steps
 about an estimated current state 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}_{k}$
\end_inset

 The error at time 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
y_{m}\ominus h\left(f^{-1}\left(x_{k},w_{k},\delta_{k:m}\right),v_{k}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and the linearized error at time 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{e}_{k:m}-H_{m}F_{k:m}\delta x_{k},

\begin_inset Formula

 is defined in lemma

 Using lemma

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}_{m}=f^{-1}\left(x_{k},0,\delta_{k:m}\right)$

 Usine errors from different time steps we get

\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}$
\end_inset

 is the observability matrix.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{O}$
\end_inset

 is full rank, then the system is locally observable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortuneately, the observability matrix is not full rank.
 However, since we are interested in tracking the target we only need to
 be able to estimate the position of the target.
 To do this, we consider two configurations for a constant velocity system.
 In the first configuration the target has a circular trajectory.
 In this case we add the constraints that the target's heading is oriented
 along the body frame velocity, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=\left[\rho_{x},0\right]^{\top}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{x}>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Using these constraints, the system is observable.
 In the second configuration the target is moving in a straight line.
 In this configuration we impose the same constraints as in the first configurat
ion except that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=0$
\end_inset

.
 Under these constraints the system is observable.
 We can identify which configuration the target is in by looking at three
 different measurements from different times.
 If the three measurement do not form a line, then the system has first
 constraints; otherwise, the latter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To improve the LMLE used to estimate the current state, we can seed it as
 follows.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{m}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{n}$
\end_inset

 be three measurements taken at different times.
 Since we observe the position of the target, we can approximate the position
 of the target at time 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{k}=y_{k}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{m}=y_{m}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{n}=y_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Using these estimated positions, we can numerically approximate the derivative
 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\dot{t}_{k} & =\frac{t_{m}-t_{k}}{\delta_{k:m}},\\
\dot{t}_{m} & =\frac{t_{n}-t_{m}}{\delta_{n:m}}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the constraint that the heading of the UAS is aligned with the translation
al velocity, we get that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R=\frac{1}{\left\Vert \dot{t}_{k}\right\Vert }\begin{bmatrix}\dot{t}_{k_{x}} & -\dot{t}_{k_{y}}\\
\dot{t}_{k_{y}} & \dot{t}_{k_{x}}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{t}_{k}=\begin{bmatrix}\dot{t}_{k_{x}}\\
\dot{t}_{k_{y}}
\end{bmatrix},
\]

\end_inset

and that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho_{k}=\begin{bmatrix}\left\Vert \dot{t}_{k}\right\Vert \\
0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{t}_{m}=R_{k}\text{Exp}\left(\delta_{k:m}\dot{\theta}_{k}\right)\rho_{k},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\theta}_{k}$
\end_inset

 is the angular velocity.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
z & =R_{k}^{\top}\dot{t}_{m}/\rho_{k}\\
 & =\left[z_{x},z_{y}\right]^{\top},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{\theta}_{k}=\text{atan2}\left(z_{y},z_{x}\right)/\delta_{k:m}
\]

\end_inset

These estimates can then be used to seed the LMLE during the RANSAC step
 of the algorithm.

\begin_inset Formula $V_{m}=I$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we have the Jacobians computed, we need to ensure that the system
 is observable.
 Since the system is nonlinear, the best we can do is ensure local observability.
 Given measurements from four different time steps, the observability matrix
 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{O}=\begin{bmatrix}H_{k:m_{1}}\\
H_{k:m_{2}}\\
H_{k:m_{3}}\\
H_{k:m_{4}}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset

The observability matrix is not full rank.
 However, under certain constraints, the system is observable.
 Since we are interested in tracking the target we only need to be able
 to estimate the position of the target.
 To do this, we consider two configurations for a constant velocity system.
 In the first configuration the target has a circular or spiral trajectory.
 In this case we add the constraints that the target's heading is oriented
 along the body frame velocity, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=\left[\rho_{x},0\right]^{\top}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{x}>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Using these constraints, the system is observable.
 In the second configuration the target is moving in a straight line.
 In this configuration we impose the same constraints as in the first configurat
ion except that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=0$
\end_inset

 and the roll in attitude (using roll, pitch, yaw) is zero.
 Under these constraints the system is observable.
 We can identify which configuration the target is in by looking at three
 different measurements from different times.
 If the three measurement do not form a line, then the system is in the
 first configuration; otherwise, the latter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the system is nonlinear, the LMLE can take a while to converge.
 We can speed up the LMLE by seeding it.
 To do this, we will use the Euler angles (roll 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, pitch 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, yaw 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

) as local coordinates and align the pitch and yaw angles with the translational
 velocities.
 The map from Euler angles configured in an NED frame to 
\begin_inset Formula $SO\left(3\right)$
\end_inset

 is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{R}\left(\phi,\theta,\psi\right)=\begin{bmatrix}c_{\theta}c_{\psi} & s_{\phi}s_{\theta}c_{\psi}-c_{\phi}s_{\psi} & c_{\phi}s_{\theta}c_{\psi}+s_{\phi}s_{\psi}\\
c_{\theta}s_{\psi} & s_{\phi}s_{\theta}s_{\psi}+c_{\phi}c_{\psi} & c_{\phi}s_{\theta}s_{\psi}-s_{\phi}c_{\psi}\\
-s_{\theta} & s_{\phi}c_{\theta} & c_{\phi}c_{\theta}
\end{bmatrix}.\label{eq:euler_to_so3}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{k},t_{m},t_{n}$
\end_inset

 denote measured positions at times 
\begin_inset Formula $n,m,k$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 being the current time and 
\begin_inset Formula $n<m<k$
\end_inset

.
 The derivative of the position vector 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is related to 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 through the rotation matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 This allows us to write the constraint
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\dot{t} & =R\rho\\
 & =\mathcal{R}\left(\phi,\theta,\psi\right)\rho.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Letting 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{t}_{k}=\left[\dot{t}_{k_{x}},\dot{t}_{k_{y}},\dot{t}_{k_{z}}\right]^{\top}$
\end_inset

, we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{bmatrix}\dot{t}_{x}\\
\dot{t}_{y}\\
\dot{t}_{z}
\end{bmatrix}=\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}c_{\theta}c_{\psi}\\
c_{\theta}s_{\psi}\\
-s_{\theta}
\end{bmatrix}}_{R_{k_{x}}}\rho_{x}.
\]

\end_inset

Since we receive position measurements, we can numerically estimate the
 positional derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{t}_{k}=\frac{t_{m}-t_{k}}{\delta_{k:m}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{t}_{m}=\frac{t_{n}-t_{m}}{\delta_{m:n}}$
\end_inset

.
 Using 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{t}_{k}$
\end_inset

 we can estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{k}$
\end_inset

 by solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{k}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{k}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{k}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{k_{x}}$
\end_inset

 using the equations 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\psi_{k} & =\text{atan2}\left(\dot{t}_{k_{y}},\left|\dot{t}_{k_{x}}\right|\right)\\
\theta_{k} & =\arctan\left(\frac{-\cos\left(\psi_{k}\right)\dot{t}_{k_{z}}}{\dot{t}_{k_{x}}}\right)\\
\phi_{k} & =0\\
\rho_{k_{x}} & =\left\Vert \dot{t}_{k}\right\Vert 
\end{align*}

\end_inset

We have set 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{k}=0$
\end_inset

 since we cannot easily estimate it unless we assume the FWA is making a
 coordinated turn as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Beard2008"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 In the absence of sideslip, a coordinated turn has the constraint
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{\psi}=\frac{g}{\left\Vert \dot{t}\right\Vert }\tan\left(\phi\right),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is the gravitational constant.
 Since we can estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 at two different time periods, we can numerically estimate its derivative
 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\psi}$
\end_inset

.
 Solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\phi_{k}=\arctan\left(\frac{\frac{\psi_{k}-\psi_{m}}{\delta_{k:m}}\left\Vert \dot{t}_{k}\right\Vert }{g}\right).
\]

\end_inset

From the estimated Euler angles 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{k}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{k}$
\end_inset

 we can construct the estimated rotation 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{k}$
\end_inset

 using equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:euler_to_so3"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly we estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{k}$
\end_inset

 using the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dot{t}_{m}=R_{k}\exp\left(\delta_{k:m}\omega_{k}\right)\rho.
\]

\end_inset

Using a first order Taylor series approximation for the matrix exponential,
 we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{R_{k}^{\top}\dot{t}_{m}}{\rho_{k_{x}}}=\begin{bmatrix}1\\
0\\
0
\end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}0\\
\omega_{k_{z}}\\
-\omega_{k_{y}}
\end{bmatrix}\delta_{k:m},
\]

\end_inset

From which we can estimate the angular rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{k_{z}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{k_{y}}$
\end_inset

, and we simply set 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{k_{x}}=0$
\end_inset

.
 These approximations are then used to seed the LMLE optimization problem.

Homography
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When tracking targets in the normalized virtual image plane (NVIP) we use
 the homography 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ma"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 to transform the measurements and models from the previous global frame
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}^{n-}$
\end_inset

, normalized virtual camera frame (NVCF), to the current global frame 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 To transform a model, we transform transform both the state extimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}^{n^{-}}$
\end_inset

 and the covariance 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{n^{-}}$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}^{n^{-}}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 In addition to transforming the models, we use the homography to transform
 the measurements; however, they are transformed exactly how the state estimate
 is transformed.
 Thus, showing how to transform the models will be sufficient.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before presenting the lemmas, we introduce notation with a little review.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t/n}^{c}$
\end_inset

 denote the position of the target with respect to the NVIP and expressed
 in the camera frame, 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{c}^{n}$
\end_inset

 denote the rotation from the camera frame to the NVCF, 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 be a matrix containing the camera's intrinsic parameters and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 a normalizing coefficient, then the target's pixel location in the NVIP
 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda\begin{bmatrix}u\\
v\\
1
\end{bmatrix}=R_{c}^{n}KP_{t/n}^{c}.
\]

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 denote the homography that maps pixels from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}^{n^{-}}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 It can be decomposed to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H=\begin{bmatrix}H_{1} & h_{2}\\
h_{3}^{\top} & h_{4}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "lem:homography_r2"

\end_inset

We assume directly that the target evolves on the configuration manifold
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}^{n^{-}}=\left[\hat{t}^{n^{-}},\dot{\hat{t}}^{n^{-}}\right]$
\end_inset

 denote the estimated state of the target in the previous frame, and 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{n^{-}}$
\end_inset

 denote the error covariance, then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\hat{t}^{n} & =g\left(H,\hat{t}^{n^{-}}\right),\\
\dot{\hat{t}}^{n} & =G\left(H,\hat{t}^{n^{-}}\right)\dot{t}^{n^{-}},\\
P^{n} & =C\left(H,\hat{x}^{n^{-}}\right)P^{n^{-}}C^{\top}\left(H,\hat{x}^{n^{-}}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
g\left(H,\hat{t}^{n^{-}}\right) & =\frac{H_{1}\hat{t}^{n^{-}}+h_{2}}{h_{3}^{\top}\hat{t}^{n^{-}}+h_{4}},\label{eq:homography_r2_pos}\\
G\left(H,\hat{t}^{n^{-}}\right) & =\frac{1}{\hat{\eta}}\left(\hat{\eta}H_{1}-\left(H_{1}\hat{t}^{n^{-}}+h_{2}\right)h_{3}^{\top}\right),\label{eq:homography_r2_vel}\\
C\left(H,\hat{x}^{n^{-}}\right) & =\begin{bmatrix}G\left(H,\hat{t}^{n^{-}}\right) & 0\\
M\left(H,\hat{x}^{n^{-}}\right) & G\left(H,\hat{t}^{n^{-}}\right)
\end{bmatrix},\nonumber \\
M\left(H,\hat{x}^{n^{-}}\right) & =\frac{2\left(H_{1}\hat{t}^{n^{-}}+h_{2}\right)h_{3}^{\top}\hat{\dot{t}}^{n^{-}}h_{3}^{\top}}{\hat{\eta}^{3}}\label{eq:homography_r2_cov}\\
 & -\frac{H_{1}\hat{\dot{t}}^{n^{-}}h_{3}^{\top}\hat{\eta}-H_{1}h_{3}^{\top}\hat{\dot{t}}^{n^{-}}\hat{\eta}}{\hat{\eta}^{3}},\\
\hat{\eta} & =\left(h_{3}^{\top}\hat{t}^{n^{-}}+h_{4}\right)^{2}.\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The homography satisfies the constraint
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda^{n}\begin{bmatrix}t^{n}\\
1
\end{bmatrix}=\lambda^{n^{-}}H\begin{bmatrix}t^{n^{-}}\\
1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset

Expanding it out gives us 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{bmatrix}\lambda^{n}t^{n}\\
\lambda^{n}
\end{bmatrix}=\lambda^{n^{-}}\begin{bmatrix}H_{1}t^{n^{-}}+h_{2}\\
h_{3}^{\top}t^{n^{-}}+h_{4}
\end{bmatrix},
\]

\end_inset

which indicates that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{n}=\lambda^{n^{-}}\left(h_{3}^{\top}t^{n^{-}}+h_{4}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 We can now substitute in 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{n^{-}}\left(h_{3}^{\top}t^{n^{-}}+h_{4}\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{n}$
\end_inset

 and solve for 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{n}$
\end_inset

 which gives 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
t^{n}=\frac{1}{\eta}\left(H_{1}t^{n^{-}}+h_{2}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta=h_{3}^{\top}t^{n^{-}}+h_{4}$
\end_inset

.
 Taking the above equation w.r.t.
 time gives us 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial g\left(H,t^{n^{-}}\right)}{\partial t} & =\frac{H_{1}}{\eta}-\frac{\left(H_{1}t^{n^{-}}+h_{2}\right)h_{3}^{\top}}{\eta^{2}}\\
 & =\frac{1}{\eta}\left(\eta H_{1}-\left(H_{1}t^{n^{-}}+h_{2}\right)h_{3}^{\top}\right).
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since the state of the model is a Gaussian random variable with mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}^{n^{-}}$
\end_inset

 and covariance 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{n^{-}}$
\end_inset

, we wish to keep the transformed state and error covariance a Gaussian
 random variable.
 We do this by linearization.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T\left(H,x^{n^{-}}\right)=\begin{bmatrix}g\left(H,t^{n^{-}}\right)\\
G\left(H,t^{n^{-}}\right)\dot{t}^{n^{-}}
\end{bmatrix},
\]

\end_inset

be the state transformation, then its linearization about 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}^{n^{-}}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T\left(H,\hat{x}^{n^{-}}\right)+C\left(H,\hat{x}^{n^{-}}\right)\delta x^{n^{-}},\label{eq:homography_r2_linearized}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $C\left(H,\hat{x}^{n^{-}}\right)$
\end_inset

 is defined in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:homography_r2_cov"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
M\left(H,\hat{x}^{n^{-}}\right) & =\left.\frac{\partial G\left(H,t^{n^{-}}\right)\dot{t}^{n^{-}}}{\partial t^{n^{-}}}\right|_{x^{n^{-}}=\hat{x}^{n^{-}}}\\
 & =\frac{-H_{1}\dot{\hat{t}}^{n^{-}}h_{3}^{\top}}{\hat{\eta}^{2}}-\frac{H_{1}h_{3}^{\top}\dot{\hat{t}}^{n^{-}}}{\hat{\eta}^{2}}\\
 & +\frac{2\left(H_{1}\hat{t}^{n^{-}}+h_{2}\right)h_{3}^{\top}\dot{\hat{t}}^{n^{-}}h_{3}^{\top}}{\hat{\eta}^{3}}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Thus the mean and covariance of 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{n}$
\end_inset

 are calculated using it's linearized form shown in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\text{cov}\left[x^{n}\right] & =C\left(H,\hat{x}^{n^{-}}\right)P^{n^{-}}C^{\top}\left(H,\hat{x}^{n^{-}}\right).
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
This proof can be trivially extended to transforming a model expressed in
 the image plane.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
We suppose directly that the target's configuration manifold is 
\begin_inset Formula $SE\left(2\right)$
\end_inset

, it's heading is aligned with it's velocity, the velocity in the body frame
 perpendicular to the heading is zero, and that the normal vector of the
 plane the target moves on points to Earth's core.
 These constraints are necessary in order to ensure observability as discussed
 in subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:tracking_image_plane"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, and to ensure we can properly transform the model.
 We also suppose directly that the state estimate of the system in the previous
 NVCF is 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}^{n^{-}}=\left(\hat{g}^{n^{-}},\hat{u}^{n^{-}}\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\hat{g}^{n^{-}} & =\begin{bmatrix}\hat{R}^{n^{-}} & \hat{t}^{n^{-}}\\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}\\
\hat{u}^{n^{-}} & =\begin{bmatrix}\hat{\rho}^{n^{-}}\\
\hat{\omega}^{n^{-}}
\end{bmatrix}\\
\hat{R}^{n^{-}} & =\frac{1}{\left\Vert \dot{\hat{t}}^{n^{-}}\right\Vert }\begin{bmatrix}e_{1}\left(\dot{\hat{t}}^{n^{-}}\right) & e_{2}\left(-\dot{\hat{t}}^{n^{-}}\right)\\
e_{2}\left(\dot{\hat{t}}^{n^{-}}\right) & e_{1}\left(\dot{\hat{t}}^{n^{-}}\right)
\end{bmatrix},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is the pixel location in the NVCF, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is the velocity in the body frame, and 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a function that extracts the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{th}$
\end_inset

 component of a tuple, then the model transformation is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\hat{R}^{n} & =H_{1}\hat{R}^{n^{-}},\\
\hat{t}^{n} & =g\left(H,\hat{t}^{n^{-}}\right),\\
\hat{\rho}^{n} & =\frac{\hat{\rho}^{n^{-}}}{h_{4}},\\
\hat{\omega}^{n} & =\hat{\omega}^{n^{-}},\\
P^{n} & =CP^{n^{-}}C^{\top},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
g\left(H,\hat{t}^{n^{-}}\right) & =\frac{H_{1}\hat{t}^{n^{-}}+h_{2}}{h_{4}},\\
C & =\text{diag}\left(\frac{1}{h_{4}},\frac{1}{h_{4}},1,\frac{1}{h_{4}},1\right).
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Under the assumptions, we can drastically simply the homography to
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H=\begin{bmatrix}R\left(\psi\right) & -\pi_{e_{3}}\left(\frac{pn^{\top}}{d}\right)\\
0 & 1-e_{3}\left(\frac{pn^{\top}}{d}\right)
\end{bmatrix},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the normalized vector that points to Earth's core, 
\begin_inset Formula $R\left(\psi\right)\in SO\left(2\right)$
\end_inset

 is the rotation from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}^{n^{-}}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}^{n}$
\end_inset

 and is a rotation about 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is the distance from the camera to the target plane, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is the translation from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}^{n^{-}}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}^{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{e_{3}}$
\end_inset

 extracts the first two components of it's argument.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
H_{1} & =R\left(\psi\right),\\
h_{2} & =-\pi_{e_{3}}\left(\frac{pn^{\top}}{d}\right),\\
h_{3}^{\top} & =0,\\
h_{4} & =1-e_{3}\left(\frac{pn^{\top}}{d}\right).
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The position and velocity expressed in the NVCF are transformed according
 to lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lem:homography_r2"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, but under the specified assumptions we can simplify the transformations
 to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
g\left(H,t^{n^{-}}\right) & =\frac{H_{1}t^{n^{-}}+h_{2}}{h_{4}},\\
G\left(H,t^{n^{-}}\right) & =\frac{H_{1}}{h^{4}}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

By the definition of the rotation matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

, we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\hat{R}^{n} & =\frac{1}{\left\Vert \dot{t}^{n}\right\Vert }\begin{bmatrix}e_{1}\left(\dot{t}^{n}\right) & e_{2}\left(-\dot{t}^{n}\right)\\
e_{2}\left(\dot{t}^{n}\right) & e_{1}\left(\dot{t}^{n}\right)
\end{bmatrix}\\
 & =\frac{1}{\left\Vert G\dot{t}^{n}\right\Vert }\begin{bmatrix}e_{1}\left(G\dot{t}^{n}\right) & -e_{2}\left(G\dot{t}^{n}\right)\\
e_{2}\left(G\dot{t}^{n}\right) & e_{1}\left(G\dot{t}^{n}\right)
\end{bmatrix}\\
 & =H_{1}\hat{R}^{n^{-}}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The velocity in the body frame is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\rho^{n} & =\left(\hat{R}^{n}\right)^{-1}G\hat{R}^{n^{-}}\rho^{n^{-}}\\
 & =\left(\hat{R}^{n}\right)^{-1}H_{1}^{-1}\frac{H_{1}}{h^{4}}\rho^{n^{-}}\\
 & =\frac{\rho^{n^{-}}}{h^{4}}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Since a rotation and translation doesn't affect the angular velocity in
 
\begin_inset Formula $SE\left(2\right)$
\end_inset

, we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega^{n}=\omega^{n^{-}}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The state 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{n^{-}}$
\end_inset

 is a Gaussian random variable with mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}^{n^{-}}$
\end_inset

 and covariance 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{n^{-}}$
\end_inset

.
 We approximate 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(x^{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 as a Gaussian random variable by linearizing the transformation about 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}^{n^{-}}$
\end_inset

 and calculating the expected value and covariance.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x^{n}\ominus T\left(H,x^{n^{-}}\right)\approx x^{n}\ominus T\left(H,\hat{x}^{n^{-}}\right)-C\delta x^{n^{-}},
\]

\end_inset

Where 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C=-\left.\frac{\partial x^{n}\ominus T\left(H,x^{n^{-}}\right)}{\partial x^{n^{-}}}\right|_{x^{n^{-}}=\hat{x}^{n^{-}}}.
\]

\end_inset

To calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 we can decompose it into blocks
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C=\begin{bmatrix}C_{11} & C_{12}\\
C_{21} & C_{22}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset

The first block is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
C_{11} & =-\left.\frac{\partial g^{n}\ominus T_{1}\left(H,g^{n^{-}}\right)}{\partial g^{n^{-1}}}\right|_{x^{n^{-}}=\hat{x}^{n^{-}}}\\
 & =\underbrace{J_{1}\left(g^{n}\ominus T_{1}\left(H,g^{n^{-}}\right)\right)}_{I}\left.\frac{\partial T_{1}\left(H,g^{n^{-}}\right)}{g^{n^{-}}}\right|_{x^{n^{-}}=\hat{x}^{n^{-}}}\\
 & =\left.\frac{\partial T_{1}\left(H,g^{n^{-}}\right)}{g^{n^{-}}}\right|_{x^{n^{-}}=\hat{x}^{n^{-}}}\\
 & =\text{diag}\left(\frac{1}{h_{4}},\frac{1}{h_{4}},1\right),
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{1}$
\end_inset

 is the part of the transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 pertaining to transforming the pose.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The off diagonal blocks are both zero matrices, and the last block is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
C_{22} & =-\left.\frac{\partial u^{n}\ominus T_{2}\left(H,u^{n^{-}}\right)}{\partial u^{n^{-}}}\right|_{x^{n^{-}}=\hat{x}^{n^{-}}}\\
 & =J_{l}\left(u^{n}\ominus T_{2}\left(H,u^{n^{-}}\right)\right)\left.\frac{\partial T_{2}\left(H,u^{n^{-}}\right)}{\partial u^{n^{-}}}\right|_{x^{n^{-}}=\hat{x}^{n^{-}}}\\
 & =\left.\frac{\partial T_{2}\left(H,u^{n^{-}}\right)}{\partial u^{n^{-}}}\right|_{x^{n^{-}}=\hat{x}^{n^{-}}}\\
 & =\text{diag}\left(\frac{1}{h_{4}},\frac{1}{h^{4}},1\right),
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}$
\end_inset

 is the part of the transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 pertaining to transforming the veclocity.
 The second diagonal term in 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{22}$
\end_inset

 pertains to the velocity that is perpendicular to the heading which we
 contrain it to be zero; thus, it is not part of the covariance and can
 be dropped to get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C_{22}=\text{diag}\left(\frac{1}{h_{4}},1\right).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Putting all of the blocks together yields 
\begin_inset Formula

C=\text{diag}\left(\frac{1}{h_{4}},\frac{1}{h_{4}},1,\frac{1}{h_{4}},1\right).

Let

\begin_layout Proof
We first recall that the probability of a Lie group element is defined in
 the Lie algebra, thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
p\left(x\right) & =\eta\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(x\ominus\hat{x}\right)^{\top}P^{-1}\left(x\ominus\hat{x}\right)\right)\\
 & =\eta\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\delta x^{\top}P^{-1}\delta x\right),
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x=x\ominus\hat{x}$
\end_inset

 is a random variable.
 The probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 might not necessarily be Gaussian depending on the function 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is nonlinear in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 is not Gaussian.
 However, we can approximate 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 as Gaussian by linearizing 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(z\mid x\right)$
\end_inset

 w.r.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 evaluated at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\hat{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c=0$
\end_inset

.
 Using the first order Taylor series yields 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
z\ominus h\left(x,c\right)\approx z\ominus h\left(\hat{x},0\right)-J\delta x+Cc.
\]

\end_inset

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x$
\end_inset

 is not a random variable in this case since we are looking at 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(z\mid x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Calculating the first and second moments of the above equation gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\text{E}\left[z\ominus h\left(\hat{x},0\right)+J\delta x+Cc\right] & =z\ominus h\left(\hat{x},0\right)-J\delta x\\
\text{cov}\left[z\ominus h\left(\hat{x},0\right)+J\delta x+Cc\right] & =CMC^{\top};
\end{align*}

\end_inset

thus, the Gaussian approximation of 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(z\mid x\right)$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\hat{e}-J\delta x\right)^{\top}\bar{M}^{-1}\left(\hat{e}-J\delta x\right)\right),
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{e}=z\ominus j\left(\hat{x},0\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{M}=CMC^{\top}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Using the Gaussian approximation for 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(z\mid x\right)$
\end_inset

, expanding out the expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 yields,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
p\left(z\right) & \approx\eta\int_{\delta x}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\hat{e}-J\delta x\right)^{\top}\bar{M}^{-1}\left(\hat{e}-J\delta x\right)\right)\\
 & \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\delta x^{\top}P^{-1}\delta x\right).
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Combining the exponents gives 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(z\right)\approx\eta\int_{\delta x}\exp\left(-L\right)\delta x,
\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L=\frac{1}{2}\left(\hat{e}-J\delta x\right)^{\top}\bar{M}^{-1}\left(\hat{e}-J\delta x\right)+\frac{1}{2}\delta x^{\top}P^{-1}\delta x.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Our next objective is to split the term 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 into two terms 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(z,\delta x\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 is quadratic in 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 and not dependent on 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(z,\delta x\right)$
\end_inset

 is quadratic in 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x$
\end_inset

.
 This will allow us to pull 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 out of the integral leaving 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(z,\delta x\right)$
\end_inset

 inside the integral resembling a Gaussian distribution which would integrate
 to a constant that we can absorb into 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, we will end up with 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(z\right)\approx\eta\exp\left(-L\left(z\right)\right).
\]

\end_inset

In order to split 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(z,\delta x\right)$
\end_inset

 we take the first and second derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 w.r.t.
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x$
\end_inset

 and compose 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(z,\delta x\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Taking the first derivative, setting it to zero and solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x$
\end_inset

 will give us the mean of 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(z,\delta x\right)$
\end_inset

, and the second derivative will provide the covariance for 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(z,\delta x\right)$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial\delta x} & =-\left(\hat{e}-J\delta x\right)^{\top}\bar{M}^{-1}J\\
 & +\delta x^{\top}P^{-1},
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial^{2}L}{\partial\delta x^{2}}=J^{\top}\bar{M}^{-1}J+P^{-1}=\Psi^{-1}.
\]

\end_inset

Setting the first derivative to zero and solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x$
\end_inset

 yields 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta x=\Psi J^{\top}\bar{M}^{-1}\hat{e}
\]

\end_inset

which we use to construct 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(z,\delta x\right)$
\end_inset

 and get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
L\left(z,\delta x\right) & =\frac{1}{2}\left(\delta x-\Psi J^{\top}\bar{M}^{-1}\hat{e}\right)^{\top}\\
 & \Psi^{-1}\left(\delta x-\Psi J^{\top}\bar{M}^{-1}\hat{e}\right).
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Next we calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $L\left(z\right)=L-L\left(z,\delta x\right)$
\end_inset

 and get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
L\left(z\right) & =\frac{1}{2}\left(\hat{e}^{\top}\bar{M}^{-1}\hat{e}-2\delta x^{\top}J^{\top}\bar{M}^{-1}\hat{e}+\delta x^{\top}\Psi^{-1}\delta x\right)\\
 & -\frac{1}{2}\left(\delta x^{\top}\Psi^{-1}\delta x+\hat{e}^{\top}\bar{M}^{-1}J\Psi J^{\top}\bar{M}^{\top}\hat{e}-2\delta x^{\top}J^{\top}\bar{M}^{-1}\hat{e}\right)\\
 & =\frac{1}{2}\left(\hat{e}^{\top}\left(\bar{M}^{-1}-\bar{M}^{-1}J\Psi J^{\top}\bar{M}^{\top}\right)\hat{e}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Applying the inversion lemma presented in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 to L
\begin_inset Formula $\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L\left(z\right)=\frac{1}{2}\hat{e}^{\top}\left(JPJ^{\top}+CMC^{\top}\right)^{-1}\hat{e}.
\]

\end_inset

Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(z\right)$
\end_inset

 can be approximated as a Gaussian distribution with mean 
\begin_inset Formula $j\left(\hat{x},0\right)$

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The above linearization serves two purposes: first, it keeps the integral
 a Gaussian distribution and it exposes the random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x_{m}$
\end_inset

 which we wish to integrate over.We can choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}_{m}$
\end_inset

 to be 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{-1}\left(x_{k},0,\delta_{k:m}\right)$
\end_inset

, since 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{-1}\left(x_{k},0,\delta_{k:m}\right)$
\end_inset

 is the mean of the linearized probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(x_{m}\mid x_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

 and thus the most likely value.
 This allows us to simplify the linearized probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p\left(x_{m}\mid x_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p\left(x_{m}\mid x_{k}\right)\approx\eta\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\delta x_{m}^{\top}\left(G_{k:m}QG_{k:m}^{\top}\right)^{-1}\delta x_{m}\right)
\]

\end_inset

since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}_{m}\ominus f^{-1}\left(x_{k},0,\delta_{k:m}\right)=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{k:m}=I$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Multiplying the two linearized probabilities together yields 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
p\left(y_{m}\mid x_{m}\right)p\left(x_{m}\mid x_{k}\right)\approx & \eta\int_{\delta x_{m}}\exp\left(-L_{m}\right)d\delta x_{m}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
L_{m} & =\frac{1}{2}\delta x_{m}^{\top}\bar{Q}_{k:m}^{-1}\delta x_{m}+\frac{1}{2}\left(y_{m}\ominus h\left(\hat{x}_{m},0\right)+H_{m}\delta x_{m}\right)^{\top}\\
 & \bar{R}_{m}^{-1}\left(y_{m}\ominus h\left(\hat{x}_{m},0\right)+H_{m}\delta x_{m}\right).
\end{align*}

\end_inset

In order to solve the integral, we decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{m}$
\end_inset

 into two functions 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{m}\left(x_{k},\delta x_{m}\right)+L_{m}\left(x_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

 where the first function depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x_{m}$
\end_inset

 and the latter function only depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 This will allow us to move the latter function out of the integral so that
 we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\int_{\delta x_{m}}\exp\left(-L_{m}\right)d\delta x_{m} & =\eta\exp\left(-L_{m}\left(x_{k}\right)\right)\\
 & \int\exp\left(-L_{m}\left(x_{k},\delta x_{m}\right)\right)d\delta x_{m}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

By constructing 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{m}\left(x_{k},\delta x_{m}\right)$
\end_inset

 to be quadratic in 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x_{m}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left(-L_{m}\left(x_{k},\delta x_{m}\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 is a Gaussian distribution, the integral would be a constant, 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int\exp\left(-L_{m}\left(x_{k},\delta x_{m}\right)\right)d\delta x_{m}=c,
\]

\end_inset

regardles of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x_{m}$
\end_inset

.
 This allows us to absorb the constant integral into 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P\left(y_{m}\mid x_{k}\right)\approx\eta\exp\left(-L_{m}\left(x_{k}\right)\right).
\]

\end_inset

To construct 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{m}\left(x_{k},\delta x_{m}\right)$
\end_inset

, we take the first and second derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{m}$
\end_inset

 w.r.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x_{m}$
\end_inset

 to get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial L_{m}}{\delta x_{m}} & =\delta x_{m}^{\top}\bar{Q}_{k:m}^{-1}\\
 & +y_{m}\ominus h\left(\hat{x}_{m},0\right)^{\top}\bar{R}_{m}^{-1}H_{m}+\delta x_{m}^{\top}H_{m}^{\top}\bar{R}^{-1}H_{m}\\
\frac{\partial^{2}L_{m}}{\delta x_{m}^{2}} & =H_{m}^{\top}\bar{R}_{m}^{-1}H_{m}+\bar{Q}_{k:m}^{-1}\\
 & =\Psi^{-1}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Setting the first derivative to zero and solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x_{m}$
\end_inset

 gives us
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\delta x_{m}^{\top}\Psi^{-1} & =-y_{m}\ominus h\left(\hat{x}_{m},0\right)^{\top}\bar{R}_{m}^{-1}H_{m}\\
\delta x_{m} & =-\Psi\left(H_{m}^{\top}\bar{R}_{m}^{-1}y_{m}\ominus h\left(\hat{x}_{m},0\right)\right).
\end{align*}

\end_inset

We can now define the quadratic function 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{m}\left(x_{k},\delta x_{m}\right)$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
L_{m}\left(x_{k},\delta x_{m}\right) & =\frac{1}{2}\left(\delta x_{m}+\Psi\left(H_{m}^{\top}\bar{R}_{m}^{-1}y_{m}\ominus h\left(\hat{x}_{m},0\right)\right)\right)^{\top}\\
 & \Psi^{-1}\left(\delta x_{m}+\Psi\left(H_{m}^{\top}\bar{R}_{m}^{-1}y_{m}\ominus h\left(\hat{x}_{m},0\right)\right)\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and solve for 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{m}\left(x_{k}\right)=L_{m}-L_{m}\left(x_{k},x_{m}\right)$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
L_{m}\left(x_{k}\right) & =\frac{1}{2}\delta x_{m}^{\top}\bar{Q}^{-1}\delta x_{m}\\
 & +\frac{1}{2}\left(y_{m}\ominus h\left(\hat{x}_{m},0\right)+H_{m}\delta x_{m}\right)^{\top}\\
 & \bar{R}_{m}^{-1}\left(y_{m}\ominus h\left(\hat{x}_{m},0\right)+H_{m}\delta x_{m}\right)\\
 & -\frac{1}{2}\left(\delta x_{m}+\Psi\left(H_{m}^{\top}\bar{R}_{m}^{-1}y_{m}\ominus h\left(\hat{x}_{m},0\right)\right)\right)^{\top}\\
 & \Psi^{-1}\left(\delta x_{m}+\Psi\left(H_{m}^{\top}\bar{R}_{m}^{-1}y_{m}\ominus h\left(\hat{x}_{m},0\right)\right)\right).
\end{align*}

\end_inset

With algebraic manipulation, using the Inversion Lemma in

\end_inset

 and substituting in 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{0}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}_{m}$
\end_inset

 we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
L_{m}\left(x_{k}\right) & =\frac{1}{2}y_{m}\ominus h\left(f_{0}^{-1},0\right)^{\top}\\
 & S_{k:m}^{-1}y_{m}\ominus h\left(f_{0}^{-1},0\right),

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S_{k:m}=\bar{R}_{m}+H_{m}\bar{Q}_{k:m}H_{m}^{\top}.

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{m}$
\end_inset

 is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x_{m}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}

 be an observation function defined in section

.
 Letting 
\begin_inset Formula $z=h\left(x,v\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e=z^{-1}y$
\end_inset

, we define the Jacobians 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
H & =-\left.\frac{\partial y\ominus z}{\partial x}\right|_{\begin{array}{c}
x=\hat{x},\\

\end{array}}\\
 & =J_{l}^{-1}\left(e\right)\left.\frac{\partial h\left(x,v\right)}{\partial x}\right|_{\begin{array}{c}

\end{array}}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
V & =-\left.\frac{\partial y\ominus z}{\partial v}\right|_{\begin{array}{c}
x=\hat{x},\\
v=0
\end{array}}\\
 & =J_{l}^{-1}\left(e\right)\left.\frac{\partial h\left(x,v\right)}{\partial v}\right|_{\begin{array}{c}
x=\hat{x},\\
v=0
\end{array}}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
With no loss in generality, we prove only the statement regarding 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 using the chain rule we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial y\ominus z}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial\text{Log}\left(e\right)}{\partial e}\frac{\partial e}{\partial z}\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}.
\]

\end_inset

From section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Lie-Theory-Review"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial\text{Log}\left(e\right)}{\partial e}=J_{r}^{-1}\left(e\right).
\]

\end_inset

The derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial e}{\partial z}$
\end_inset

 is defined as letting 
\begin_inset Formula $z=h\left(x,v\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e=z^{-1}y$
\end_inset

.
 According to the chain rule
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
 & \lim_{\alpha\to0}\frac{\left(\left(z\text{Exp}\left(\alpha\right)\right)^{-1}y\right)\ominus\left(z^{-1}y\right)}{\alpha}\\
 & =\lim_{\alpha\to0}\frac{\text{Log}\left(y^{-1}z\text{Exp}\left(-\alpha\right)z^{-1}y\right)}{\alpha}\\
 & =\lim_{\alpha\to0}\frac{\text{Log}\left(\text{Exp}\left(-\mathbf{Ad}_{y^{-1}z}\alpha\right)\right)}{\alpha}\\
 & =-\mathbf{Ad}_{y^{-1}z}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Putting the derivatives together gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial\text{Log}\left(e\right)}{\partial e}\frac{\partial e}{\partial z}\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} & =-J_{r}^{-1}\left(e\right)\mathbf{Ad}_{e}\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\\
 & =-J_{l}^{-1}\left(e\right)\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

After evaluating it, we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H=J_{l}^{-1}\left(e\right)\left.\frac{\partial h\left(x,v\right)}{\partial x}\right|_{\begin{array}{c}
x=\hat{x},\\
v=0
\end{array}}
